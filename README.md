# Timberborn-WindPlugin
Are you tired of your windmills not running? Well you should be! But not to worry, with this
mod you can alter some wind and windmill values so that your windmills can always produce power!

# Installing
Recommended way to install this mod is through (Thunderstore)[https://timberborn.thunderstore.io/]. If you want to install
manually or some other way, then you are on your own. I know likely less about these things
than you.

# Usage
Once you have installed the mod run the game once and exit. In your bepinex folder there should
now be a config file for this mod. The config has 6 different values
* MinRequiredWindmillWindStrength: The minimun required wind strength when regular windmills will generate power (default: 0.3)
* MinRequiredLargeWindmillWindStrength: The minimun required wind strength when large windmills will generate power (default: 0.2)
* MinWindStrength: The minimum strength the wind will be at any point (default: 0)
* MaxWindStrength: The maximum strength the wind can be (default 1)
* MinWindTimeInHours: The shortest guaranteed time a wind will stay the same in hours (default 5)
* MaxWindTimeInHours: The longest possible time a wind till stay the same in hours (default 12)
The default values are the same as in the base game. Change these to whatever as you desire. Results may wary.
